It's a program that allows to design graphs, step through algorithms and gain insight into their internal state. It helps to understand the working principles of graph algorithms. Graph colouring and visual representation of data objects is used to make it as intuitive as possible.  

#### Aims:
* assist teaching  
* serve as stand-alone learning tool (so accompanying verbal explanation is not required)   
* consolidate understanding by observing algorithms behaviour on custom graphs  

# Installation
Download and unpack [release.zip](./release.zip), then run "graph_algorithms_tool.exe" file.  

# Background 
It was created for CE301 Capstone Project module, based on the [Project Choices Database proposal](https://moodle.essex.ac.uk/mod/data/view.php?d=490&perpage=30&search=a+tool+for+teaching&sort=0&order=ASC&advanced=0&filter=1&f_3666=&f_3667=&u_ln=&f_3671=&f_3672=) by Dr. Michael Sanderson:  
>The aim of this project is to implement a tool to assist with the teaching of graph algorithms such as those taught in CE204.  
>  
>It should provide a graphical display of step-by-step implementation of the algorithms with accompanying descriptive text. This should be offered at various levels of abstraction (e.g. for Kruskal's algorithm a version showing the connection sets and a more abstract version that uses the concept of not forming a cycle). It should be able to work on arbitrary graphs (i.e. the descriptions should not be based on a particular graph).  
>  
>Ideally there should also be a graphical user interface that allows the user to create graphs by adding nodes at points on the display and creating edges to connect them, allowing the user's chosen graph to be used to demonstrate the algorithm.
